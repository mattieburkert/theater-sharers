				<p>Z.C.22 (43), Folger Shakespeare Library. A manuscript consisting of one and a half membrances of vellum, written in legal Secretary hand and lightly ornamented.</p> 
				<p> The manuscript is accompanied by a five-page typescript entitled "A transcript of Z.C.22(43) An Indenture for one-half share of Lisle's Tennis Court". The typescript pages are numbered two (2) through six (6); no page one (1) is present. The running header attributes the typescript to Hook, whom I presume to be Lucyle Hook.</p>
